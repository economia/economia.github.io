This 80-minute, incredibly well-produced documentary gives us a personal look
into the catastrophic impact that junk food corporations and other sugary
products have on Brazilian youth, where 33% of all children are overweight or
obese.

The key problem is demonstrated by frequent interviews of both children and
their parents: they are mostly unaware of just how much sugar is contained in
innocently packaged snacks that big brands market to kids.

Unfortunately, education alone is [not a solution][] as long as poverty rate
remains high and junk foods are cheaper than vegetables.
