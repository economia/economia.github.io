Prior to [Railsberry][] in Kraków, I participated in a Rails Girls workshop by
helping coach 40+ girls that attended the [event in Applicake's offices][pics].

It's been a fun and rewarding experience for me, and I look forward to where
empowering more women with knowledge & skill takes us.

Next workshops take place in different cities in Europe, one in Buenos Aires,
and there's rumors of Rails Girls in San Francisco. There's even a guide [how to
organize a workshop in your city][guide].
