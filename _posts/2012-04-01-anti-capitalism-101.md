Steve Klabnik in an essay he adapted from prior work:

> Servicing men and children at home serves capital: by making housework and
> reproduction a women’s ‘natural and feminine’ process rather than work,
> capitalism benefits in the form of free labour. When capital pays husbands
> they get two workers, not one. Denying domestic labour a wage makes this work
> invisible, and divides the working class into waged and unwaged at the expense
> of both.

Money is used to generate more money. Not even people at "the top" (i.e. the
bosses) are in control of this; money controls _them_ by swapping them out as
soon as they fail to deliver adequate capital accumulation relative to the
competition. It's a self-perpetuating mechanism, powered solely by the
participation of the working class.
