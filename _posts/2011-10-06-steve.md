<img src=/images/steve.jpg> Three years ago I have spent all my savings to buy my first Mac, dropped out of college, moved away from home and since then let nothing blur my vision or turn me away from what I believed in.

Before that I was disillusioned with computers and mobile and was ready to quit. I learned that computers can be beautiful and software life-changing. Technology is about humans again.

My best work is still ahead of me.<br> I will never stop learning.
