I've released a new version of hub and made a significant improvement to its website.

**hub is a command-line tool** that wraps git to make it smarter about dealing
with GitHub repositories. If you haven't tried out hub yet, and are using
GitHub, now's a good chance to take a peek.

My favorite features of hub are definitely `fork` and `pull-request` commands:

{% highlight sh %}
$ git fork
# push the topic branch to my new fork:
$ git push -u mislav feature
$ git pull-request
â†’ (opens the text editor to write the pull request message)
{% endhighlight %}
