The big 1.0 of [Zepto][] is approaching fast, so we pushed a v1.0 release
candidate. This release also features a shiny new documentation site, which some
folks on Twitter already prefer as a reference even if they use jQuery.

Zepto is a small library that implements most of jQuery's functionality in a
cleaner manner, targeted for modern browsers and mobile clients. It's leaner,
faster to load, and easier to read the source of (which I definitely recommend
if you want to brush up on your JavaScript).
