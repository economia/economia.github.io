Tara Tiger Brown in ["Dear Fake Geek Girls: Please Go Away"][fake], currently
the most popular article on Forbes (<q>Information for the World's Business
Leaders</q> indeed):

> Today the word [geek] is the exact opposite of its original meaning; a term
> once used to inflict social cruelty is now a term of endearment, everyone and
> their dog self-proclaims themselves as a geek in whatever passing interest
> they have. **The definition of ‘geek’ is so broad now that it is
> meaningless.**

There's a word that originally had derogatory meaning and culture [turned it into
a positive term][reap]. _We should be glad_ that this is happening, considering so
many words undergone the _opposite_ transformation, from positive/neutral to
pejorative (e.g. "nigger", "gay").

> Pretentious females who have labeled themselves as a “geek girl” figured out
> that **guys will pay a lot of attention to them** if they proclaim they are
> reading comics or playing video games.

Those damn females, how dare they seek attention from men! We men would _never_
partake in activities that might result in us receiving attention.

> [...] we just need to **expose the posers** for who they are and shine the light
> much more brightly on **those that are the real deal**.

Wait, didn't we just assert that the definition of "geek" is broad? Did Tara
suddenly invent a Geiger counter for geekdom between the paragraphs? What harm
are these "posers" doing, and what methods exactly should we apply to weed them
out?

But then she sure <q>shines the light</q> on a 13 year old girl called Luna:

>  I’ve spoken to Luna about her sewing projects [...] so I know firsthand how
>  talented she is. The thing that strikes me the most is how **humble and
>  casual she is about her skills**. It made me think about a few online
>  personalities who would have taken 10 pictures of themselves threading the
>  needle and making their first stitch in order to get a bunch of likes on
>  Instagram.

So a good girl in Tara's book seems to be:

1. humble;
2. "casual";
3. doesn't post pictures of herself on the Internet;
4. shouldn't receive likes on Instagram.

> Girls who genuinely like their hobby or interest and document what they are
> doing to help others, not garner attention, are true geeks.

First rule of women's hobby club: you do not talk about women's hobbies. If you
are a woman, you may _document_ what you are doing to <q>help others</q>, but you
are not allowed to receive attention for it.

That reminds me of [Charles Darwin's misconception][coy] about the behavior of
human females (in the context of mating):

> the female, on the other hand, with the rarest exceptions [...] is coy, and
> may often be seen endeavoring for a long time to escape from the male.

**What a load of crap all this is.** It's no surprise that it comes from a woman
who suggested that [<q>the goal ‘learn how to code’ is a waste of your
time</q>][code], and whose greatest achievement is [<q>giving
birth</q>][profile]. It's a surprise, though, that this same woman often wrote
positively in the past about women in technology, including the piece where she
criticizes the stereotype about women being ["good at shopping"][shopping]:

> The only way to show [the female VC] that the sky is truly the limit for women
> and that natural abilities are not gender specific, women and men just do some
> things differently, is to show your expertise to her and any other doubters
> that are still of the mindset that women are naturally good at X.
> 
> To do that, us women that want to do a tech startup, or any business, need to
> raise our hands, speak up, write about it, show what you are good at and
> passionate about.

Great advice from Tara. Unfortunately, it's in direct contradiction with what
she is saying in her latest article. She's the kind of person to ask "Where are
all the women in technology" and then when geek girls appear, she tells them to
<q>Please go away</q>.

Tara is just one of many people that are determined to shame and exlude women on
pretense that they are "attention-seekers", "fake" or just not hardcore enough.
It happens when a group is male-dominated; sports and gaming are good examples.
A woman immediately becomes a suspect when she joins a group: is she here
because she _really_ likes the topic or she only participates to get attention?
Of course, we can't ask her because she'll just lie. So we have to probe her
brain.

Whatever the definition of "geek" is, it doesn't include gender. If we're really
on a mission to <q>expose the posers</q>, why concentrate on just women?

The answer is: it's not about these girl geeks being "fake". It's about these
geeks being _female_. That _this_ is posed as a problem is a problem in it of
itself.
