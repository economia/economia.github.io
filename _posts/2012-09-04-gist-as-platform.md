Did you know you can use Gists for:

*   Publishing your [Markdown-based writing with gist.io](http://gist.io)?

    Sure, gists already display rendered Markdown, but it's got all that noisy
    UI around it that drowns the content. Gist.io [renders your gists
    beautifully](http://gist.io/3135754).

*   Render [HTML demos with bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org)?

    Showcase your [working CSS/JS example](http://bl.ocks.org/1353700) along
    with syntax-highlighted code needed to make it happen.

*   Showing [browser-based presentations with GistDeck](https://gistdeck.herokuapp.com/)?

    Turns [simple Markdown
    syntax](https://raw.github.com/gist/b273f7a3089b1a238f5a/gistfile1.md)
    into a slide deck. Indistinguishable from magic.

Unrelated to the services above, here's a pick of some of [my recent gists][my]
that might be interesting:

* my [zsh prompt](https://gist.github.com/1712320)
* [`rb` shell function that makes rbenv easier](https://gist.github.com/3402583)
* tiny [GeoIP service class for Ruby](https://gist.github.com/3608766)
* catch [misspelled "initialize" method names in Ruby](https://gist.github.com/3387743)
* the good, bad, and the ugly of [short URL resolving](https://gist.github.com/3596663)
* stupid simple [pure-ruby JSON parser & generator](https://gist.github.com/1505877)
* shortest ["hello {NAME}" Ruby server examples](https://gist.github.com/1291242):
  Sinatra, pure Rack, pure WEBrick, pure Ruby
